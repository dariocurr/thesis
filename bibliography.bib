	             RDF Database Systems is a cutting-edge guide that distills everything you need to
	             know to effectively use or design an RDF database. This book starts with the basics
	             of linked open data and covers the most recent research, practice, and technologies
	             to help you leverage semantic technology. With an approach that combines technical
	             detail with theoretical background, this book shows how to design and develop semantic
	             web applications, data models, indexing and query processing solutions. Understand
	             the Semantic Web, RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, and OWL within the context of relational database
	             management and NoSQL systems Learn about the prevailing RDF triples solutions for
	             both relational and non-relational databases, including column family, document, graph,
	             and NoSQLImplement systems using RDF data with helpful guidelines and various storage
	             solutions for RDF Process SPARQL queries with detailed explanations of query optimization,
	             query plans, caching, and more Evaluate which approaches and systems to use when developing
	             Semantic Web applications with a helpful description of commercial and open-source
